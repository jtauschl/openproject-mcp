</p>

OpenProject CE MCP is organized into a small number of narrow layers with a
strict, one-directional dependency order: MCP presentation, Application
Services, Policies/Resolvers, domain API Ports/Adapters, and a single Transport.
Each domain (projects, work packages, versions, …) follows this same shape — a
narrow port, an adapter, resolver(s) where needed, policies, an Application
Service, and a thin `client.py` facade delegation — so a new domain's design
decisions are largely settled by the existing pattern rather than invented from
scratch. `client.py` itself stays a thin, auth/transport/error-mapping facade;
the domain logic and policy checks live one layer down instead of accumulating
in that one file.

## Layers

### `config.py`

- Parses environment variables into an immutable `Settings` object.
- Applies safe defaults: project scope is fail-closed (empty/unset
  `OPENPROJECT_READ_PROJECTS`/`WRITE_PROJECTS` denies all project-scoped access,
  regardless of the write-category flags below), explicit page limits apply, and
  every mutation always requires `confirm=true` — there is no way to skip that
  confirmation.
- Centralizes scope interpretation for:
  - read gating
  - scoped write enablement
  - project read/write allowlists
  - hidden field configuration

### `client.py`

- Owns all OpenProject HTTP transport (auth, timeouts, error mapping) and the
  shared project-identifier cache.
- Every domain's public method is a one-line delegation into `app/` (see
  "Layered architecture" below) — normalization, write previews/confirmation,
  and the runtime policy model (read gates, scoped write gates, project scoping,
  hidden-field masking) live in `app/policies/`, `app/services/`, and
  `app/adapters/` instead.
- Two deliberate exceptions stay as `client.py`-level orchestration rather than
  a Service (`get_project_work_package_context`, `get_my_project_access`): each
  combines more than one domain in a single call, and a Service must not depend
  on another Service.

`app/policies/` is the main policy boundary of the project.

### `models.py`

- Defines the response shapes returned by the MCP tools.
- Keeps tool responses stable and compact.
- Decouples MCP-facing output from raw OpenProject payloads.

### `tools.py` and the per-domain tool modules

- Each domain's MCP tools live in their own `tools_<domain>.py` module (e.g.
  `tools_projects.py`, `tools_work_packages.py`) on top of the client: validates
  and normalizes user input before it reaches the client, and translates
  internal exceptions into MCP-safe tool errors.
- `tools.py` itself holds no tool functions -- only `enabled_tool_names()`/
  `register_tools()` and the scope-classification constants (which tool belongs
  to which read/write scope), plus a side-effect import of every
  `tools_<domain>.py` module and a re-export of names still imported directly by
  some tests.
- `tools_runtime.py` is the shared kernel every domain module depends on: the
  `@register_tool` decorator/registry, `_client_from_context`/`_run_tool`, error
  categorization, and the return-model/select-trimming machinery.
- `tools_validation.py` holds the generic, domain-crossing field validators
  every domain module imports from.
- Every tool result is a `models.py` dataclass trimmed by the presentation seam
  (`presentation._to_payload`: `select`, hidden-field masking, confirmed-payload
  drop). The one thing JSON cannot carry -- an attachment's image or text as a
  native MCP content block -- goes through `presentation.ContentBundle`: the
  bundle's `body` still takes the normal trimmed path and becomes the leading
  JSON block, and only the extra blocks travel outside it. Blocks are built in
  the tool layer, since nothing under `app/` may import the `mcp` SDK.

### `server.py`

- Wires MCPServer to the tool set.
- Creates the shared app context and client lifecycle.
- Keeps startup and shutdown logic isolated from domain code.

## Layered architecture

`client.py` is the thin facade described above. Every domain's public methods on
`OpenProjectClient` are one-line delegations to a layered implementation under
`app/`:

```text
tools_<domain>.py (MCP presentation)
    -> Application Services (app/services/)
        -> Policies (app/policies/, no I/O)
        -> Resolvers (app/resolvers/, I/O only via a port)
            -> Domain API ports/adapters (app/ports/, app/adapters/)
                -> Transport port -> HttpxTransport (app/transport/)
```

- **Policies** are pure functions (scope/allowlist matching, hidden-field
  masking, read/write gates) with no I/O — every domain shares a single,
  dependency-free, directly-unit-testable source of truth for this
  security-relevant logic.
- **Ports** are narrow, per-domain Protocols — no universal gateway. A port
  holds only contracts and port-owned data types (the Protocol itself, its
  Result dataclasses, and small port-level constants/conversions) — never
  HAL→model mapping. **Adapters** are the concrete HTTP implementation of a
  port, translating HAL payloads into the compact dataclasses from `models.py`.
  The pure HAL-to-model `normalize_*` functions live in the adapter, not the
  port — Services never call them directly, and may depend on Ports but not
  Adapters.
  - A domain's `Record` may carry a lazily-computed `to_detail` field
    (`Callable[[], <Domain>Detail]`) instead of an eager one, when the domain's
    `list()` path never reads it and the detail normalizer does extra work
    beyond a cheap field-copy — this defers that work until `get()` actually
    needs it.
  - A domain whose returned record's parent link carries no reliable
    identifier/title of its own carries the raw HAL link dict, not just an
    extracted href string, since the allowlist check and project-candidate
    matching need more than `href` off it.
  - A Port may offer a raw-`dict`-returning method alongside its normalized
    Record methods when the original flat code read a single field off a payload
    without ever fully normalizing it — forcing full normalization there would
    raise a spurious exception on a payload shape the original never needed to
    parse completely (e.g. a payload missing an unrelated required field like
    `id`). Confirmed recurring, not a one-off: `EmojiReactionApi.get_activity`
    and `ReminderApi.get_remindable_link` both exist for this exact reason.
  - A Port's normalize method may take an extra required keyword argument beyond
    the raw payload when the wire response itself carries no field identifying
    something the Service already knows from its own call context —
    `CostApi.to_costs_by_type_result(payload, *, work_package_id)` stamps the
    resolved work package id onto `WorkPackageCostsByTypeResult` because
    OpenProject's `WorkPackageCostsByTypeRepresenter` payload has no field
    naming the work package it summarizes (only a `self` link an adapter would
    otherwise have to re-parse for a value the Service already holds). Mirrors
    `TimeEntryApi.to_record(payload, *, text_limit)`'s existing shape of a
    second, Service-supplied argument alongside the payload.
  - Small text/href-parsing helpers (`trim_text`, `id_from_href`, `link_title`,
    `delimit_user_content`, `origin_from_url`, `link_to_web_url`,
    `can_update_from_links`, plus `SUBJECT_LIMIT`) are shared via
    `app/adapters/_text.py`; every adapter imports what it needs from there
    rather than duplicating them. Helpers that differ meaningfully between
    adapters (`_normalize_validation_errors`, `_extract_formattable_text`) stay
    local per adapter — unifying genuinely different logic would change
    behavior, not just remove duplication. A small number of package-root
    shared-kernel modules exist for the same reason outside the adapter layer:
    `app/api_href.py` (a relative-API-href builder), `app/form_result.py` (a
    shared `FormResult` dataclass, aliased under each domain's own name in its
    port module), and `app/origin.py` (a same-origin-check helper usable from
    both Adapters and Services, since Services cannot import from Adapters).
  - A helper still needed by a different, still-flat sibling domain in
    `client.py` cannot be deleted from there when a domain migrates — it is
    duplicated (verified byte-identical) into the new adapter instead, rather
    than importing across the module boundary.
  - A caller-supplied id that can contain URL-path-unsafe characters is
    percent-encoded (`quote(<id>, safe="")`) before being interpolated into a
    request path.
  - A domain whose per-item read-allowlist check can fail on a
    malformed/unexpected raw field may have its `list()` Port method return raw,
    unnormalized elements (plus any server-reported total) instead of pre-built
    Records — the Service then filters the raw elements against the allowlist
    FIRST and normalizes only the survivors, so an out-of-scope item's malformed
    field can never raise before the allowlist ever gets a chance to drop it,
    and no normalization work is wasted on items the caller could never see.
    This is a deliberate divergence from the more common "Adapter always
    normalizes, Service filters the already-normalized Records" shape — pick the
    shape that matches whether filtering can safely happen on already-normalized
    data for that specific domain.
- **Resolvers** turn a semantic reference (a version name, a project identifier)
  into a concrete id, using only a port — never an Application Service. Project
  and reference resolution happens through a request-scoped resolution context:
  a single top-level call touching the same project more than once performs the
  read/write-allowlist check once, not once per touch, without ever skipping it
  outright. A domain whose id is always already-numeric or an opaque string
  (validated by its `tools_<domain>.py` module) needs no dedicated Resolver at
  all — it depends directly on the shared `ProjectRefResolver` seam
  (`app/ports/project_ref.py`) when it needs to resolve an optional `project`
  filter, and on nothing else.
- **Application Services** orchestrate a single use case: Policy checks,
  Resolver calls, port calls, and the preview/confirm write state machine. They
  depend on a port's Protocol type, never a concrete adapter — enforced by
  `tests/test_architecture_boundaries.py`. The shared preview/ confirm state
  machine (`app/services/_write_outcome.py`) is reused by any domain with 2+
  write actions sharing the same result shape; a domain with fewer stays a
  single flat method instead of forcing indirection onto one or zero call sites.
  A domain bundling several unrelated-but-adjacent read-only lookups under one
  ticket is one Service, not one per lookup, when every method shares an
  identical read-enablement gate — this does not require every bundled method to
  share the exact same scope string: one method reusing a different,
  pre-existing scope than its siblings inside the same Service is a one-line
  variation, not a reason to split the domain apart. A domain with no project
  link and no allowlist concept at all (self-scoped to the token owner, not
  project-scoped or admin-scoped) uses neither a Policy module nor
  `app/policies/scope.py`'s helpers — the read/write scope gate alone is its
  entire enforcement surface. A domain whose parent resource is a work package
  rather than a project resolves that reference through the shared
  `WorkPackageIdResolver`/`WorkPackageProjectAllowedCheck` seams
  (`app/ports/work_package_ref.py`), the work-package-reference equivalent of
  `ProjectRefResolver` — a Service can depend on more than one domain-API Port
  at once when two of its methods each need a genuinely different capability
  (e.g. reference resolution for one method, a raw payload fetch for another),
  rather than forcing every dependency through a single seam that doesn't fit
  both shapes. `WorkPackageIdResolver(ref, write=True)` also directly replaces
  the flat-code idiom of a manual work-package fetch plus a write-allowlist
  check on its project link, when a write method's caller-supplied reference
  must itself be resolved (as opposed to a write method already holding a
  concrete numeric id derived from another resource's own link). A `list()` that
  fans out across several *different* work packages in one response (one per
  record, not a single anchor) uses `WorkPackageProjectAllowedCheck` directly,
  paired with a fresh, request-scoped `WorkPackageAllowedContext` cache
  (`app/ports/work_package_resolution.py`) so two records sharing the same work
  package are checked only once — this per-record filtering is Service-level
  logic, not a Policy module, since the check itself does I/O (a conditional
  work-package fetch) and `app/policies/` is documented as pure, no-I/O. A
  Service may touch the local filesystem directly (path-traversal containment, a
  sensitive-filename denylist, reading file bytes) when the domain's write path
  is a local file upload — this is authorization/security logic, not HAL↔model
  translation, so it stays in the Service layer rather than the Adapter,
  matching every other authorization check's home (`AttachmentService`'s
  `_prepare_attachment_file`/ `_is_sensitive_attachment` is the first and, so
  far, only instance). A Port method may reach into an otherwise entirely
  unmigrated, different domain for exactly one field a write path needs to
  validate against (`AttachmentApi.get_max_attachment_size_bytes()` reads
  Instance Configuration's `maximumAttachmentFileSize` without migrating that
  domain) — a deliberate, narrow exception to "a Port covers its own domain,"
  used specifically to avoid an unrelated domain's full migration becoming a
  hidden prerequisite for the one actually being migrated. A Service whose raw
  HAL elements are shaped identically to another domain's own resource (e.g. a
  saved query's embedded results are literally work-package HAL payloads)
  depends directly on that other domain's Port — never on its own copy of the
  normalization logic and never by importing the concrete Adapter's
  `normalize_*` function, which would violate the Service->Port-only dependency
  rule. This is the cross-domain-Port-dependency counterpart to the
  field-reach-in exception above: `QueryExecutionService` depends on
  `WorkPackageApi` directly and calls its `to_record()` Protocol method (a Port
  method deliberately exposed as a Protocol method rather than a module-level
  function specifically to make this kind of reuse safe) to normalize each
  embedded work package, matching `WorkPackageService`'s own pre-existing
  precedent of depending on `ActivityApi` directly for `add_comment()`'s reuse
  of the Activities normalizer. Hidden-field masking
  (`hidden_fields.apply_hidden_fields`) tags its result with a dynamic
  `_hidden_keys` attribute, not a declared dataclass field —
  `dataclasses.replace(...)` on an already-stamped value builds a brand-new
  instance carrying only the declared fields, silently dropping that tag. Any
  Service method that both stamps a result AND transforms it afterward via
  `dataclasses.replace` (e.g. a post-processing filter step) must stamp AFTER
  the replace, not before, or the transformed result comes back fully unmasked.
  A domain's WRITE methods do not necessarily share the same read-enablement
  gate as its READ methods — verify each write method's flat-code original
  individually rather than assuming a domain-wide convention: Work Packages'
  `create`/
  `create_subtask`/`update`/`delete`/`bulk_create`/`bulk_update`/`add_comment`
  deliberately never call `access.ensure_read_enabled`, unlike that same
  domain's `search`/`list`/`list_my_open`/`get`, which all gate on it as their
  first action — an instance can have work-package writes enabled with reads
  entirely disabled, and every write path (including an internal, write-adjacent
  lookup like the auto-percentage/auto-remaining-time derivation's status-detail
  fetch, which is why that lookup goes through `StatusPriorityTypeApi` directly
  rather than `StatusPriorityTypeService`) must keep working in that
  configuration.
- A single MCP-level domain may mix OpenProject's form-based and flat write
  patterns across its own sub-resources, rather than committing the whole domain
  to one shape — the Meetings domain (5 sub-resources: Meetings, Meeting Agenda
  Items, Meeting Sections, Meeting Outcomes, Recurring Meetings + virtual
  Occurrences) is the first to do this. Meetings itself mounts a genuine `POST
  meetings/form`/`POST meetings/{id}/form` schema-validation step upstream, so
  `MeetingService` follows the form-based preview/commit shape
  (`_write_outcome.py`'s `_finalize_write`, matching
  `BoardService`/`TimeEntryService`); its four sub-resources have no form
  endpoint at all upstream (verified against source, not assumed), so their
  Services stay flat inline preview/commit methods (matching
  `WikiPageLinkService`). A sub-resource whose parent is another sub-resource in
  the same domain, not a project — Meeting Agenda Items/Sections/Outcomes have
  no project link of their own, only a parent (or grandparent) Meeting —
  resolves its allowlist check by depending directly on `MeetingApi` as a
  cross-domain Port, walking `agenda_item -> meeting -> project` (or `section ->
  meeting -> project`) as needed, the same cross-domain-Port-dependency pattern
  as `QueryExecutionService -> WorkPackageApi`/`WorkPackageService ->
  ActivityApi` above, and `MeetingOutcomeService`'s two-hop walk additionally
  depends on `MeetingAgendaItemApi` (three Protocol dependencies total, matching
  `FileLinkService`'s/`EmojiReactionService`'s three-Protocol shape). A resource
  addressed by its own bare id under a global namespace (not nested under its
  parent's id in the URL, e.g. `GET meeting_agenda_items/{id}`, `GET
  meeting_outcomes/{id}`) is safe to fetch-then-check directly — i.e. fetch the
  record, read its own already-normalized parent-id field, then check the
  allowlist against that — WITHOUT the Wiki Page Links-style two-argument
  "verify the fetched record's id actually belongs to a caller-supplied claimed
  parent" step, when and only when the upstream single-resource route itself
  performs an authoritative server-side join through to the project (verified
  per-route against source, e.g. `MeetingAgendaItem.joins(meeting:
  :project).merge(Meeting.visible).find(id)`) — there is no caller-supplied
  parent id on such a route to distrust in the first place, unlike `DELETE
  wiki_page_links/{id}`, which has no such join and must scan the claimed
  parent's own children to verify a match. Recurring Meetings' virtual
  Occurrences (no id of their own, addressed by `start_time`) fetch their parent
  `RecurringMeeting` first, the same shape as any other sub-resource whose
  parent is a different resource in the same domain — `RecurringMeetingService`
  reuses `httpx_meeting_api.py`'s `normalize_meeting` (an Adapter importing a
  pure function from a sibling Adapter module) to normalize `init_occurrence`'s
  response, which is a full Meeting HAL payload rather than an Occurrence
  payload — Adapter-to-Adapter reuse of a stateless normalizer is permitted by
  the layer-dependency rules (which restrict Service→Adapter imports, not
  Adapter→Adapter), matching how `app/adapters/_text.py`'s helpers are already
  shared across every adapter in the tree. A list result whose upstream
  collection carries no `offset`/`pageSize` pagination envelope at all (verified
  per-route, not assumed from a domain-wide pattern) is modeled with its own
  bespoke `*ListResult` shape rather than the shared `PageResult` base —
  `RecurringMeetingOccurrenceListResult` deliberately omits
  `offset`/`limit`/`next_offset`/`truncated` and carries only `count`/`results`
  plus its own two identifying fields (`recurring_meeting_id`, `filter`), since
  fabricating a pagination envelope for a genuinely unpaginated collection would
  claim capabilities (resumable paging) that don't exist server-side.
- `HttpxTransport` (`app/transport/httpx_transport.py`) is the only module under
  `app/` that imports `httpx`; `client.py`'s own HTTP calls (used only by the
  two cross-service-orchestration methods described above) and
  `retry_transport.py` are unaffected and keep importing it directly. The
  `Transport` Protocol (`app/transport/protocol.py`) is extended with a new
  method when a domain needs a request shape none of the existing methods cover
  — e.g. `post_raw_json` for a raw, non-JSON request body (`Content-Type:
  text/plain`), added when a domain's endpoint posts plain text rather than a
  JSON payload; `post_multipart` for a `multipart/form-data` body (a JSON
  metadata part plus a file part), added for Attachments' file upload — the
  metadata part is sent as a plain form field with no filename in its
  Content-Disposition, since a filename would make the server's multipart parser
  treat it as an uploaded file rather than a JSON string.
- `OpenProjectClient` remains a 100%-compatible facade: each domain's public
  method signatures stay unchanged unless a deliberate, separately-decided
  behavior change was bundled into a past migration — in which case the domain's
  matching tool in its `tools_<domain>.py` module gained the same change, the
  only kind of tool-layer edit a domain migration itself ever requires. The two
  `client.py`-level orchestration methods that combine multiple domains
  (`get_project_work_package_context`, `get_my_project_access`) stay as
  `client.py`-level orchestration rather than moving into a single Service,
  since a Service must not depend on another Service.

An `ast`-based test (`tests/test_architecture_boundaries.py`) enforces the layer
directions above, confines `httpx` to `HttpxTransport`, forbids importing the
`mcp` SDK or reading environment variables directly anywhere under `app/`, and
checks that every `app/services/`/`app/resolvers/` class depends on a port
`Protocol`, never a concrete adapter. These checks are directory-driven, not
domain-specific. Each domain also has a small, deliberately non-generalized
regression test
(`test_<domain>_service_binds_the_api_param_to_<domain>_api_specifically`) that
pins its exact port type, kept alongside the generic check rather than folded
into it. Complementary behavioral-contract tests
(`tests/unit/test_write_confirm_contracts.py`,
`tests/unit/test_write_payload_equivalence.py`) prove, for every registered
write/delete MCP tool, that writes stay preview-only until confirmed, that no
mutating call happens before confirmation or without the required write scope,
and that the previewed and actually-sent payloads match.

Every domain that started out as flat `client.py` code has been migrated through
these same `app/` layers — `client.py` is now the thin facade described above,
plus the two deliberate cross-service-orchestration exceptions. See this
project's internal engineering-docs companion repository for the step-by-step
migration process this used and its per-migration history; it is intentionally
not duplicated here, since this file describes only the current architecture.

Two domains (Wiki Page Links, Query execution) were added directly against these
`app/` layers with no flat `client.py` predecessor to migrate from — genuinely
new API surface, not a migration. For a domain built this way, "the domain's
matching tool gained the same change" above does not apply as written: every
migrated domain's tools were already registered in `tools.py`'s classification
constants (`READ_TOOLS_BY_SCOPE`/`WRITE_TOOLS_BY_SCOPE`/
`_PROJECT_SCOPED_READ_TOOLS`) before its Service existed, so a migration's own
`tools.py` diff was always zero; a wholly new domain's tools do not pre-exist
there and must be registered as part of building it, the same as any new tool
name.

The User Non-Working Times / User Working Hours domains
(`app/ports/user_non_working_time_api.py`,
`app/ports/user_working_hours_api.py`) are the first domains gated by neither a
project allowlist (`OPENPROJECT_READ_PROJECTS`/`WRITE_PROJECTS`) nor the
existing `admin`/`personal` scopes: their resource
(`/api/v3/users/{user_id}/non_working_times`,
`/api/v3/users/{user_id}/working_hours`) has no project concept at all, and
OpenProject's own authorization is a route-level, per-request gate (`@user ==
current_user || current_user.allowed_globally?(:manage_working_times)`, else a
404 rather than a 403, to avoid confirming the target user exists) that this MCP
cannot usefully duplicate client-side. Both Services therefore have no Resolver
and no dedicated `<domain>_policy.py` — the only access decision left to this
codebase is its own dedicated `user_schedule` scope
(`OPENPROJECT_ENABLE_USER_SCHEDULE_READ`/`_WRITE`, both default `false`), a pure
surface-exposure opt-in independent of OpenProject's own server-side check,
following the established one-scope-per-domain pattern (Board, Version,
Membership, Project each have their own pair) rather than overloading `admin`
(which would incorrectly block ordinary self-service) or `personal` (which has
no `user_id` parameter anywhere in its existing tools).

The two domains also split across this project's two documented
no-single-GET/has-single-GET delete patterns within one ticket: OpenProject
mounts no `GET .../non_working_times/{id}` route at all, so
`UserNonWorkingTimeService.update()`/`delete()` resolve the target record by
scanning `list_for_user()`'s full result first (the same shape
`WikiPageLinkService.delete()` uses), while `GET .../working_hours/{id}` does
exist, so `UserWorkingHoursService.get()`/`update()`/`delete()` use a real
single-resource GET (`BoardService.delete()`'s pattern) instead. Both
collections are also unpaginated on OpenProject's side
(`UserNonWorkingTimeCollectionRepresenter`/
`UserWorkingHoursCollectionRepresenter` both subclass `UnpaginatedCollection`,
verified against source) — both Services fetch the whole collection in one call
(`offset=1, page_size=settings.max_results`) and slice it client-side via
`pagination.paginate_client`, the same shape `RoleService.list_roles` already
established as this codebase's precedent for a genuinely unpaginated collection,
rather than being force-fit into a server-paginated tool signature.

## Naming conventions

The code intentionally mirrors OpenProject source names at the API boundary. Do
not rename OpenProject concepts into more generic MCP names when the spelling
comes from the REST API, HAL links, query filters, or documented payload fields.

- Work package text is `subject`, not `title`.
- News and document text is `title`, because those resources use title fields.
- Time-entry dates use `spent_on`, matching the OpenProject payload.
- OpenProject timestamps keep `*_at`; calendar-only fields keep `*_date`.
- Query filters use the source-defined filter keys such as `type_id`,
  `version_id`, `assigned_to_id`, `status_id`, `priority_id`, `project_id`, and
  `subject_or_id`.
- HAL slug identifiers such as action, capability, query column, query operator,
  and sort-by ids stay strings. Database primary keys use numeric `*_id` names.
- MCP tool parameters use simple user-facing names (`project`, `version`,
  `work_package_id`). Internal helper names may use `*_ref` when the value can
  be a numeric id or a semantic/name reference, and `*_id` only when the value
  is known to be numeric.

This keeps the implementation source-conformant while still making internal
resolution steps explicit.

## Request flow

Typical read flow:

1. MCP client calls a tool in its domain's `tools_<domain>.py` module
2. tool input is validated and normalized
3. the domain's Application Service (`app/services/`) checks read gating and
   project scope via `app/policies/`
4. the domain's Adapter (`app/adapters/`) calls the OpenProject API through
   `HttpxTransport`
5. raw payloads are normalized into dataclasses
6. the MCP tool returns compact JSON

Typical write flow:

1. MCP client calls a mutating tool in its domain's `tools_<domain>.py` module
2. tool input is validated
3. the domain's Application Service checks project scope and write enablement
   via `app/policies/`
4. write payload is prepared, often through OpenProject form endpoints
5. validation preview is returned unless `confirm=true`
6. confirmed write executes and the response is normalized

## Why form endpoints matter

OpenProject exposes many writable schemas and allowed values through form
endpoints. The MCP relies on those endpoints to:

- validate candidate writes before executing them
- resolve allowed values for fields such as status, type, priority, activity,
  and custom fields
- provide safer previews instead of blindly sending writes

That is why a large part of the write path lives in each domain's Application
Service instead of direct `POST` or `PATCH` calls.

## Safety model

The project aims for a defense-in-depth model rather than a single global
switch.

The model has two independent layers:

**Layer 1 — MCP server gates** (env var flags, checked before any HTTP call):

- the 9 individual `OPENPROJECT_ENABLE_<GROUP>_READ` flags (which read scopes
  are exposed at all; `OPENPROJECT_ENABLE_EXTENDED_READ` opt-in exposes a
  rarely-used subset of metadata tools, `OPENPROJECT_ENABLE_ADMIN_READ` opt-in
  exposes the instance-wide user/group list)
- scoped write-group flags such as `OPENPROJECT_ENABLE_WORK_PACKAGE_WRITE`, plus
  `OPENPROJECT_ENABLE_ADMIN_WRITE`
- `OPENPROJECT_READ_PROJECTS` / `OPENPROJECT_WRITE_PROJECTS` (fail-closed: empty
  or unset denies all project-scoped access on that side)
- `OPENPROJECT_HIDE_<ENTITY>_FIELDS` / `OPENPROJECT_HIDE_CUSTOM_FIELDS` (see
  [Field hiding](field-hiding.md))
- preview-by-default writes — every mutation always requires explicit
  `confirm=true`, with no bypass
- attachment content (`get_attachment_content`, `include_images`) is bounded by
  `OPENPROJECT_ATTACHMENT_CONTENT_MAX_BYTES` while streaming — the cap protects
  memory and network transfer, not just the response — is authorized against
  the container work package's project before a single byte is fetched, is
  never written to disk, and follows OpenProject's storage redirect with the
  `Authorization` header kept on a same-origin hop and dropped on a
  cross-origin one, so instance credentials never reach a pre-signed
  object-storage URL

**Layer 2 — OpenProject server permissions** (enforced by the API, not the MCP):

The MCP server acts on behalf of the user whose API token is configured. If that
user lacks the required role or project permission in OpenProject, the API
returns HTTP 403 regardless of what the MCP flags allow. The MCP maps this to a
`PermissionDeniedError` which is surfaced as a tool error to the agent. The
agent can recognize the cause from the error message and stop attempting the
operation.

This means the MCP flags are a ceiling — they restrict what the agent can
attempt — but OpenProject's own role system is the final authority. Setting
`ENABLE_WORK_PACKAGE_WRITE=true` does not grant the configured user any
permissions they do not already have in OpenProject.

Important properties of the current model:

- writes are always bounded by readable project scope
- an empty or unset `OPENPROJECT_READ_PROJECTS`/`OPENPROJECT_WRITE_PROJECTS`
  disables all project-scoped reads/writes respectively — fail-closed, not
  fail-open
- hidden fields are masked on reads and rejected on writes
- destructive operations still use the same project-scope checks as
  non-destructive writes
- instance-global admin operations (list/view users and groups, plus user/group
  management) are gated behind
  `OPENPROJECT_ENABLE_ADMIN_READ`/`OPENPROJECT_ENABLE_ADMIN_WRITE` — an ordinary
  read/write pair like every other scope, but neither is bounded by
  project-scoped write flags, and both default off since the data (instance-wide
  PII) has no project-scope safety net
- external file storage connections (Nextcloud/OneDrive/Sharepoint) share the
  same `OPENPROJECT_ENABLE_ADMIN_READ`/`_WRITE` gate as Users/Groups — a genuine
  admin-only operation in OpenProject's own API. Each project's link to a
  configured storage (`project_storages`) is instead a normal project-scoped
  read (`OPENPROJECT_ENABLE_PROJECT_READ` plus `OPENPROJECT_READ_PROJECTS`, same
  as Documents) — OpenProject's own API gates it per-project, not admin-only,
  and there is no write endpoint for it at all
- most metadata tools (statuses, types, priorities, notifications, …) are always
  available and not gated by any read flag; a rarely-used subset (query schema
  tools, `render_text`, `get_custom_option`, help texts, working days) is off by
  default behind `OPENPROJECT_ENABLE_EXTENDED_READ` to save context
- `list_notifications` filters by `OPENPROJECT_READ_PROJECTS`, but under a
  restricted (non-empty, non-`*`) scope this only filters the current
  server-side page — an empty filtered page does not guarantee no further
  allowed notifications exist on later pages, since the notifications endpoint
  has no server-side project filter to paginate against

## Supported scope (Community Edition)

The MCP targets OpenProject **Community Edition** only. The following feature
areas are in scope:

- Projects, memberships, roles, principals, project admin context, project
  configuration
- Work packages, statuses, priorities, types, categories (read), relations,
  subtasks, attachments, watchers, activities
- Versions, boards/queries, views
- Backlogs sprints (read, plus assigning/unassigning a work package's sprint;
  requires the Backlogs module)
- News, documents (read/update only), wiki pages (single-page fetch only — no
  list endpoint in OpenProject v3)
- Time entries, Nextcloud file links (CE feature, degrades gracefully)
- External file storage connections (Nextcloud/OneDrive/Sharepoint, admin-only;
  OneDrive/Sharepoint creation is rejected by OpenProject itself on a Community
  Edition instance without an Enterprise token) and each project's link to a
  configured storage (read-only)
- Users, groups, user preferences, notifications
- Grids, help texts, working days, custom options, text rendering
- Project lifecycle phases (read only, degrades gracefully if unavailable)
- Instance configuration, query metadata, actions and capabilities

## Explicit non-goals / Enterprise exclusions

The following are intentionally **not supported** and have been removed from the
codebase:

| Feature | Reason |
| --- | --- |
| Programs (`/api/v3/programs`) | Enterprise Edition only |
| Portfolios (`/api/v3/portfolios`) | Enterprise Edition only |
| Placeholder users (`/api/v3/placeholder_users`) | Enterprise Edition only |
| Budgets (`/api/v3/budgets`) | Enterprise Edition only |
| Custom actions (execute) | Enterprise Edition only |
| Baseline comparisons | Enterprise Edition only |
| OpenID Connect / SAML SSO management | Enterprise Edition only |
| Storage file browsing (`storage_files`) / `prepare_upload` | Distinct, more complex domain; upload is Enterprise-gated for OneDrive/Sharepoint even where implemented — out of scope beyond the storage connection/link management already covered |

API stubs with no POST/DELETE endpoint in CE (read/update only, matching
OpenProject v3 API reality):

| Feature | Available operations |
| --- | --- |
| Documents | GET list, GET single, PATCH update |
| Wiki pages | GET single only — the collection endpoint (`/api/v3/projects/{id}/wiki_pages`) is not implemented in OpenProject v3; `list_wiki_pages` has been removed |
| Categories | GET list, GET single |
| Forums Posts | GET single only — no collection endpoint (`/api/v3/posts`) and no separate "forums" resource exist in the API at all; `list_posts` cannot be implemented |
| Project storages | GET list, GET single — no POST/PATCH/DELETE endpoint exists in the API at all for this resource; manage the underlying storage connection instead |

## Design tradeoffs

Reasons for the layered structure over one large flat file:

- security-relevant checks (read/write gates, project scope, hidden-field
  masking) live in one pure, dependency-free, directly-unit-testable module
  (`app/policies/`) shared by every domain, instead of being reimplemented or
  copy-pasted per domain
- a narrow port `Protocol` is trivial to fake in a unit test; a monolithic
  client with many concrete responsibilities is not
- a smaller, single-purpose module (one domain's Service/Adapter/Resolver) is
  easier to review correctly than a change buried inside a much larger file
- `HttpxTransport` is the only module that imports `httpx`, enforced by a static
  test — every other layer depends on the `Transport` Protocol, never the
  concrete HTTP client library
- each domain follows the same shape (port, adapter, resolver(s), policies,
  Application Service, thin `client.py` delegation), so a new domain's design
  decisions are largely settled by the existing pattern

The tradeoff is more files and more indirection to trace a single request
through than a flat design would have — mitigated by every domain following the
identical shape, so once one domain is understood, the rest read the same way.
