# Tool reference

All tools exposed by the OpenProject MCP server.

All mutating tools follow the same guarded write pattern by default:

- Call the tool without `confirm=true` to get a preview or validation result.
- Call it again with `confirm=true` to execute the write or delete.

If `OPENPROJECT_AUTO_CONFIRM_WRITE` is explicitly enabled, the preview step is skipped for all writes, including deletes.

All list tools are bounded and paginated. They return compact summaries — not raw OpenProject HAL payloads.
