"""Architecture tests for the tool classification in tools.py.

These are structural/name-based invariants over the classification constants
(READ_TOOLS_BY_SCOPE — including the "personal"/"extended" groups —
WRITE_TOOLS_BY_SCOPE, PERSONAL_MUTATION_TOOLS, ADMIN_WRITE_TOOLS,
ADDITIONAL_READ_SCOPES_BY_TOOL) and over enabled_tool_names().

Expectations are computed independently from the classification constants,
never by calling enabled_tool_names() as its own oracle — otherwise a bug in
the selection logic could compare itself to itself and stay green.
