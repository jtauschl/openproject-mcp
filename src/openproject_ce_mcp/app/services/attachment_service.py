"""Application Service for the Attachments domain.

Depends on the `AttachmentApi` Protocol (never `HttpxAttachmentApi`
concretely -- enforced by the architecture-boundary test), on
`WorkPackageLookupApi` directly, and on `WorkPackageIdResolver`. Three
Protocol dependencies, matching File Links' shape: `list_for_work_package`'s
anchor-resolution and `create()`'s caller-supplied-reference resolution both
go through `WorkPackageIdResolver`, while `get()`'s and `delete()`'s
container-derived id go through `WorkPackageLookupApi.get()` directly --
both already hold a concrete href from the fetched attachment's own
`_links.container`, not a caller-supplied reference to resolve.

No `attachment_policy.py`: `list()`'s scoping is entirely delegated to
`WorkPackageIdResolver` (read-check on the anchor work package happens
THERE, before the attachments sub-fetch, matching File Links/Emoji
Reactions); `get()`/`delete()`'s scoping is a direct
`scope_policy.ensure_project_link_allowed`/`ensure_project_write_link_allowed`
call against the container work package's own project link, fetched via
`WorkPackageLookupApi.get()`.

`create()` and `delete()` are each independent, inline preview/confirm
methods -- NOT the shared `app/services/_write_outcome.py` state machine.
That machine's threshold ("2+ write actions sharing the same shape") looks
satisfied on paper (both write actions return `AttachmentWriteResult`), but
`_finalize_write` specifically expects a `<domain>/form`-validated payload
(a `form` dict with `_embedded.payload`/`validationErrors`) -- Attachments'
`create()` has no such form endpoint at all (a direct multipart POST with a
hand-built preview), so the shapes are genuinely heterogeneous, not merely
differently-named. There is also no shared "delete finalizer" anywhere in
`app/` to reuse for `delete()` either -- `FileLinkService.delete()` is
itself a fully inline preview/confirm method, the real precedent this
Service's `delete()` follows.

Filesystem-access security logic (`_attachment_root`/`_is_sensitive_attachment`/
`_prepare_attachment_file`/`_validate_attachment_size`) lives HERE as private
Service methods, not in the Adapter: this is authorization/security logic
(bounding which local files a caller can upload), not HAL<->model
translation, so it belongs at the same layer every other authorization check
in this codebase lives at. This is the first Service under `app/` to touch
the local filesystem at all.

`get_max_attachment_size_bytes()` on `AttachmentApi` reaches into the otherwise
entirely unmigrated, global Instance Configuration domain for exactly the
one field `_validate_attachment_size` needs -- a deliberate, narrow
cross-domain dependency (not the "raw sibling-domain resource" pattern
`EmojiReactionApi.get_activity`/`ReminderApi.get_remindable_link` follow, see
`attachment_api.py`'s own docstring), chosen specifically to avoid migrating
the complete Instance Configuration domain as a side effect of this one.

Read/write scope reuses `"work_package"` (not a dedicated `"attachment"`
scope).
