hidden fields) rather than a model definition, so it does not belong in

    """A tool result that is a normal dataclass PLUS native MCP content blocks.

    The one shape in this codebase whose response is not exhausted by JSON:
    an attachment's image or text has to reach the model as an ImageContent/
    TextContent block, or the model cannot see it at all — a base64 string
    inside a JSON field is just tokens.

    Rather than letting such a tool bypass the trimming seam entirely (no
    ``select``, no hidden-field masking, no confirmed-payload drop), the
    bundle keeps ``body`` on exactly the normal path: ``tools_runtime``'s
    wrapper trims it with ``_to_payload`` like any other result, serializes
    that to one leading JSON text block, and appends ``blocks`` after it. A
    tool returning a bundle therefore still honours every presentation policy;
    only the extra blocks travel outside it, which is the part JSON cannot
    carry.

    ``blocks`` is typed ``Any`` on purpose: the blocks are ``mcp`` SDK objects,
    and this module — like everything under ``app/`` — stays free of an ``mcp``
    import. They are built in the tool layer, which already depends on the SDK.

    """Serialize a tool result to a trimmed plain dict for context reduction.

    Recursively turns dataclass instances into dicts while applying structural
    omissions that would otherwise cost fixed context on every call:

    - **payload**: dropped from a write result once ``state`` is ``"confirmed"``
      (the success case), since the normalized ``result`` already carries the same
      information. It stays on preview/validation-error results, where the agent
      still needs it. Applied recursively, so nested bulk items are trimmed too.
    - **count / truncated**: dropped from list results — both are derivable
      (``count == len(results)``, ``truncated == next_offset is not None``).
    - **next_offset**: never dropped, even when ``None`` — it is the pagination
      control field, and callers page until it comes back ``null``, not until
      it is absent.
    - **hidden keys**: removed entirely (not nulled) when the client tagged
      the instance with ``_hidden_keys``.
    - **None-valued fields**: dropped when ``elide_none`` is true, kept as an
      explicit ``null`` otherwise. An empty list/dict is always kept regardless
      (it means "present but empty", distinct from "not applicable"). ``elide_none``
      reflects the *calling tool's* serialization policy, not the shape of the
      dataclass currently being serialized: it is set once by the
      ``tools_runtime.py`` registration wrapper — true when the tool accepts a ``select`` parameter
      (so a caller who wants a ``None`` field back can request it explicitly),
      false when it does not (so nothing would otherwise be able to recover an
      elided field). It is threaded unchanged through every recursive call,
      including into nested row lists and nested entities, since a nested
      dataclass never has its own ``select`` — the policy is a property of the
      top-level tool call, not of whichever type happens to be nested inside it.
    - **selected fields**: requesting a field via ``select`` guarantees its
      presence in the response, even when its value is ``None`` — see
      ``_select_fields``. This is how a caller distinguishes "unset" from
      "not requested" for select-capable tools. The one deliberate exception
      in the other direction: a failed batch/bulk item's nested entity is
      still emitted as an explicit ``null`` (see ``_select_fields``'s
      ``_SELECT_NESTED_FIELD`` branch) regardless of ``select`` contents —
      there, ``null`` means "this item failed", not "no value", and eliding
      it would make failed items indistinguishable from a missing key.

    ``select`` is applied to the top-level row list — ``results`` for list reads,
    or ``items`` for bulk write results — keeping just the requested fields per
    row. For a row type registered in ``_SELECT_NESTED_FIELD`` (e.g. a batch-read
    item that wraps a single work package, or a bulk item that wraps a single
    write result, rather than being the entity itself), ``select`` instead trims
    that nested entity — the row's own wrapper fields (id/success/error, or
    index/success/error) are kept regardless of ``select``. When the top-level
    value itself has neither ``results``/``items`` NOR ``payload``/``next_offset``
    (a genuinely bare single-entity result, e.g. ``WorkPackageDetail`` —
    excluding ``payload``/``next_offset`` deliberately keeps a bare
    ``*WriteResult`` like ``WorkPackageWriteResult`` on the normal per-field
    path even though it also lacks ``results``/``items``, so its
    confirmed-payload-drop and next_offset handling stay intact if such a
    type ever gains ``select``), ``select`` instead trims the top-level
    object directly, via the same ``_select_fields`` used for rows — this is
    what lets a single-entity ``get_*`` tool support field selection despite
    not being a list/bulk result.

    Non-dataclass values pass through unchanged, so tools (and test stubs) that
    already return plain dicts are untouched.
