"""Tool-registration, dispatch, error-translation, and trimming mechanics.

This module is the shared kernel every domain's tool functions (each living
in its own per-domain `tools_<domain>.py` file; `tools.py` itself holds no
tool functions, only registration/classification infrastructure) depend on:
the `@register_tool` decorator + registry, `register_selected_tools()` (the
mechanical half of registration), request-scoped MCP `Context` access, error
categorization, and the return-model/select-trimming machinery.

Strictly one-directional: this module never imports from `tools.py`, any
`tools_<domain>.py`, or `app/` -- it only imports from `.client`, `.models`,
`.presentation`, and stdlib/`mcp`. Which tools exist and which scope/policy
gates them is Catalog/Policy concern, owned by `tools.py`, not this module --
`register_selected_tools()` takes an already-decided iterable of tool names,
never `Settings` or the classification tables themselves.

    resolves each name to its registered function and applies the
    error-categorization/trimming wrapping shared by every tool.

    Tools that return a list/write/bulk result are routed through _to_payload for
    context reduction: payload is dropped on confirmed writes,
    count/truncated on lists, and `select` trims rows. Those tools are registered
    with structured_output=False so the SDK does not build a fixed dataclass
    output schema — it serializes the trimmed dict we return verbatim, letting us
    omit keys. Detection is by the result model's fields, so no per-tool tagging
    is needed and it cannot drift. Tool bodies are unchanged; they still return
    their dataclass, which the wrapper trims.

    When `hide_active` is set (i.e. any hide-field config is active), every
    dataclass-returning tool is trimmed too, so single-entity reads (get_*) can
    drop hidden keys entirely rather than emit them as null. This only widens
    schema loss when the operator opted into hiding.
