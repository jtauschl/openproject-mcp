"""Interactive setup: registers the openproject MCP server with clients and writes .mcp.json.

Runs in two modes:

* **installed** — the package was installed from PyPI (pip/uv/pipx). The server
  command written into client configs is the installed ``openproject-ce-mcp``
  binary (resolved via PATH), and ``.mcp.json`` is written to the current
  directory (project-local) or a global client config.
* **clone** — running from a source checkout. Dependencies are installed with
  ``uv``/pip, the command points at ``.venv/bin/openproject-ce-mcp``, and
  project-scoped config lands in the launch directory.
