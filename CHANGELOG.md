### Tools

- **Projects** — list, get, create, copy (with background job tracking), update, delete;
  read admin context, project configuration, and lifecycle phase definitions/instances
- **Work packages** — list with structured filters (`project`, `type`, `version`,
  `has_description`); free-text search with optional `project`, `status`, `open_only`,
  `assignee_me` filters; get, create, subtask, update, delete; add comments; create/delete
  relations; get relations and activity log; bulk create and bulk update; list own open
  work packages
- **Watchers** — list, add, remove
- **Attachments** — list, get, upload, delete
- **File links** — list, delete (Nextcloud CE integration)
- **Time entries** — list, get, create, update, delete; list available activities
- **Versions** — list (global or project-scoped), get, create, update, delete
- **Boards** — list, get, create (basic and grouped), update, delete; list saved views,
  get view
- **Memberships** — list, get, create, update, delete; list roles and principals; get
  current user's project access
- **Users** — get current user; list, get, create, update, delete, lock, unlock
- **Groups** — list, get, create, update (full member-list replacement with add/remove
  helpers), delete
- **Documents** — list, get, update (no create/delete endpoint in CE API)
- **News** — list, get, create, update, delete
- **Wiki pages** — get single page by id; no list tool (CE API v3 has no collection
  endpoint — `GET /api/v3/projects/{id}/wiki_pages` is not implemented)
- **Categories** — list, get (no write API in CE)
- **Notifications** — list, mark single read, mark all read
- **Grids** — list, get, create, update, delete
- **User preferences** — get, update (always available — no write gate required)
- **Instance configuration** — get
- **Query metadata** — get filter, column, operator, sort-by; list/get filter-instance
  schemas
- **Help texts** — list, get
- **Working days** — list working-day configuration; list non-working days
- **Custom options** — get
- **Relations (global)** — list, update
- **Actions & capabilities** — list
- **Text rendering** — render markdown or plain text to HTML via OpenProject API

### Permission model

- Scoped read flags per chain: `OPENPROJECT_ENABLE_PROJECT_READ`,
  `OPENPROJECT_ENABLE_WORK_PACKAGE_READ`, `OPENPROJECT_ENABLE_MEMBERSHIP_READ`,
  `OPENPROJECT_ENABLE_VERSION_READ`, `OPENPROJECT_ENABLE_BOARD_READ` (all default `true`)
- Scoped write flags per chain: `OPENPROJECT_ENABLE_PROJECT_WRITE`,
  `OPENPROJECT_ENABLE_WORK_PACKAGE_WRITE`, `OPENPROJECT_ENABLE_MEMBERSHIP_WRITE`,
  `OPENPROJECT_ENABLE_VERSION_WRITE`, `OPENPROJECT_ENABLE_BOARD_WRITE` (all default `false`)
- `OPENPROJECT_ENABLE_ADMIN_WRITE` — dedicated opt-in for instance-wide user and group
  management; never activated by project-scoped write flags (default `false`)
- No global shortcut flags — each scope must be enabled explicitly
- Two-layer safety model: MCP env-var gates (ceiling) + OpenProject server-side role
  permissions (final authority); a `403` from OpenProject surfaces as a tool error

### Architecture

- Five-module layout: `server.py`, `config.py`, `client.py`, `models.py`, `tools.py`
- All policy logic (read gates, write gates, project scoping, field hiding) concentrated
  in `client.py` for easier security review
- Preview/confirm two-step pattern for all writes and deletes; bypassable globally via
  `OPENPROJECT_AUTO_CONFIRM_WRITE` or per class via `OPENPROJECT_AUTO_CONFIRM_DELETE`
- Project allowlists matched case-insensitively against identifier, name, and numeric ID;
  hyphenated name variant tested for HAL-embedded links
- Field hiding per entity type via `OPENPROJECT_HIDE_<ENTITY>_FIELDS`; hidden fields are
  rejected on writes too
- HAL responses normalized into compact dataclasses; raw payloads never forwarded to MCP
  clients
- Pagination bounded by `OPENPROJECT_DEFAULT_PAGE_SIZE`, `OPENPROJECT_MAX_PAGE_SIZE`,
  `OPENPROJECT_MAX_RESULTS`
- Form validation against OpenProject schema endpoints before create/update writes

### Test coverage

- 152 unit tests (httpx mock transport, no network)
- Integration test suite (`tests/integration/`) against a live OpenProject instance;
  excluded from the default run, opt in with `-m integration`

### Scope

- Community Edition only — Enterprise features (Placeholder Users, Budgets, Portfolios,
  Programs, Custom Actions, Baseline Comparisons) are not implemented
- Nextcloud file links included (CE feature; returns empty list gracefully if Nextcloud
  not connected)
- Project lifecycle phases included (read-only; degrades gracefully if unavailable)

### Known API notes

- `GET /api/v3/projects/{id}/wiki_pages` is not implemented in OpenProject v3;
  `list_wiki_pages` is therefore not provided. Individual pages are accessible via
  `get_wiki_page`.
- Project-scoped endpoints for work packages and versions are deprecated in OpenProject
  17.2 in favour of workspace-scoped alternatives; the deprecated paths remain in use as
  the workspace-scoped alternatives are not yet stable in CE.
- Relations use the canonical `/api/v3/relations` endpoint with a filter instead of the
  redirecting project-scoped path.
- Groups PATCH requires a complete `_links.members` array (full replacement); the client
  fetches the current list and applies adds/removes before sending.
